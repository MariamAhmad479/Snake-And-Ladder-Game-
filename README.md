# 🐍 Snake and Ladder Game  
### Python GUI Board Game Implementation

## 📌 Overview

This project is a digital implementation of the classic **Snake and Ladder** board game developed using Python. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Tkinter** and supports both:

- 👥 Multiplayer (Player vs Player)
- 🤖 Single Player (Player vs Computer)

The system integrates game logic, dice simulation, snake and ladder mechanics, and file-saving functionality to provide a complete interactive experience.

## 🧠 System Design

The project is modular and structured using multiple functions that handle:

- Window navigation and GUI management
- Player turn switching
- Dice generation
- Player movement logic
- Snake and ladder position mapping
- File handling for saved games
- Game state persistence

The system follows a hierarchical structure and event-driven programming model.
